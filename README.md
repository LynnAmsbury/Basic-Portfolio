Overview:

In this assignment, build a professional portfolio site using HTML/CSS. Design an aesthetically pleasing layout while creating different kinds of complex HTML elements using semantic HTML.

Specifications:

Colors: Pro-tip: Use the Eye Dropper Chrome extension to find the colors used on web pages.
Teal color (used for headings and backgrounds): #4aaaa5
Regular font color (used for paragraphs and all text besides the headings): #777777
Main header background color: #ffffff
Main header border color: #cccccc
Footer background color: #666666
Main content background color: #ffffff
Main content border color: #dddddd

Fonts:
For heading fonts use font-family: 'Georgia', Times, Times New Roman, serif;.
For all other fonts use 'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;.

Profile Image found on index.html:
Use a picture of yourself.
If you don't have a picture, you can grab a placeholder image from LoremPixel. Save the images to your images folder.

Portfolio Images:
Placeholder images can be found at LoremPixel.
Save the images to your images folder.

Background Images:
The background pattern used was found on Subtle Patterns. You can browse through that site and find whichever pattern you like.

Dimensions:
The entire content and the main section content area is 960px wide.
Pro-tip: Use the Page Ruler extension to measure the size of elements.

Bonus:

Make the pages more sophisticated by adding style to text links, to image links, and to buttons for when a user hovers their cursor over them.
You can use Adobe Kuler to find colors that match the theme (in this case, the primary color is Teal #4aaaa5).

Make a "sticky footer." You will notice the dark grey footer will always rest just below the content. This is fine whenever your site has enough content to push it down past the height of most monitors. But if there isn't much content in the body, the footer could rest in the middle of the page:

Try to code the footer in a way that it will always remain at the bottom of the page, no matter how short the content is. A sticky footer tutorial can be found here.
Give the Footer the following CSS: border-top: 8px solid #4aaaa5;
