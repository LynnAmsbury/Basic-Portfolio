                <p>Hi! I'm Lynn, a Denver metropolitan-area website developer-in-training! I'm sure that at some point
                    this project will become an actual portfolio site to showcase all of the things we have done in this
                    coding boot camp (and maybe some things we have done on our own, if we have), and this introductory
                    paragraph should explain what my areas of greatest interest and expertise are. However, for the time being
                    I'm a student of website development and a very new one at that, and I don't know what my areas of
                    greatest interest and expertise are yet. I'll update this as I figure them out. I have had a lot of fun with
                    this project, though, so maybe front-end and user interface will become areas I focus on.</p>
